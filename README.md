Build Automation
what is build automation?
Build automation is automating the process of preparing code
for deployment to a live environment.
So depending on what programming languages
or frameworks are used to create the code,
many times code needs things done to it
before it's ready for deployment.
It may need to be compiled.
It may need to be linted, minified, transformed.
It may need to have unit tests run against it.
And build automation means taking all of these steps
and automating them so that they occur in a consistent
and automated way.
And this is usually done using a build script
and/or a build tool.
